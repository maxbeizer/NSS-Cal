This is functionally equivalent to calling Unix cal with those arguments (cal 12 2012) and the output of your program should match that of Unix cal.

We will expand upon this basic functionality to include printing of a full calendar year and a foray back into the world of web programming.

Objectives
Practice with Arrays, Hashes, and Strings
Develop the logic of a non-trivial algorithm
Programming to meet a (changing) specification
Requirements
Your program must have tests. These test may be as high-level or as low-level as you wish.
You may not use any of the built-in Ruby classes that provide date, time, or calendar functionality.
You may not use exec, Kernel, etc. to shell out to any Unix programs.
You should not use "magic" numbers.
You must commit your code at least once per day and push it to your github repository.
As a capstone project, this should demonstrate your skills. Do not share code with your peers. You can help each other think about the problems, but don't help each other code.
